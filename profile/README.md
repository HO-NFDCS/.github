# Home Office Fire and Rescue Data and Analytics Platform™

## About

The Incident Recording System (IRS) has been used 24/7 by all GB Fire and Rescue Services (FRSs) for the collection and recording of record-level incidents attended data over the past 15 years.

The Home Office is replacing the IRS, with a new, modern national Fire and Rescue Data Platform (FaRDaP™) be collaboratively built with Rowe IT Limited. It will follow industry standard best practice and it is focused on being 
 easily extended with minimal cost of change to collect other future record-level fire datasets from FRSs such as operational workforce, prevention, and protection.

Overtime, the new System shall enable multiple fire datasets to be collected electronically via multiple channels (web-based forms and services APIs) and transmitted securely between the Home Office and FRSs. The System shall be a 
 national repository of all FRS fire datasets and shall also be capable of producing reports, downloads, enable quality assurance workflow and benchmark type analytics.

## GitHub Organisations

This GitHub Organisation contains all the internal development resources and code associated with the FaRDaP™ system.
